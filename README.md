"How can you generate a synthetic dataset, standardize its features, apply K-Means clustering, predict the cluster for a new data point, and explain the cluster assignment?
Steps Explained
Import Necessary Libraries:

Libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.cluster.KMeans, and sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler are imported to handle data operations, visualization, clustering, and scaling.
Generate a Synthetic Dataset:

make_blobs from sklearn.datasets is used to create a synthetic dataset with 300 samples, 3 centers (clusters), and 2 features.
The dataset is converted into a pandas.DataFrame for better handling.
Standardize the Features:

StandardScaler is used to standardize the features (mean=0 and variance=1).
The standardized data is then fit to the K-Means model.
Apply K-Means Clustering:

KMeans is used to fit the standardized data to find 3 clusters.
The cluster labels are added to the original data DataFrame.
Define a Function to Predict the Cluster for a New Data Point:

predict_cluster function takes a new data point, scales it using the same scaler, and predicts its cluster using the trained K-Means model.
Define a Function to Explain the Cluster Assignment:

explain_cluster function takes a new data point, scales it, calculates distances to each cluster centroid, and provides an explanation of which cluster the new data point is closest to and the distance.
